        I am currently the Senior Baseball Writer at <a href="https://baseball.realgm.com/" target="_blank">RealGM</a>,
        where I cover all aspects of the MLB, and occasionally other sports.
        My writing here includes reviews of team transactions, longform articles and general analysis. The site's main
        focus is on providing statistical analytics to professional sports teams in the United States, especially
        the NBA. RealGM wanted to grow their involvement among sports consumers, however, which is where
        I come in. I write articles to drive up interest among fans, both casual and serious.
        A full list of articles I have written is available <a href="https://baseball.realgm.com/news/analysis/author/219/John-Watson" target="_blank">on their website</a>,
        but I've included some favorite pieces here.
