  I am currently the Senior Baseball Writer at RealGM. My writing here includes
  transactions, previews longform articles and general analysis. The site's main focus is on
  providing statistical analytics to professional sports teams in the United States, especially
  the NBA. RealGM wanted to grow their involvement among sports consumers, however, which is where
  I come in, writing articles which will drive up interest among fans, both casual and __.
