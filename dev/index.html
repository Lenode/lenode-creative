        I'm John Watson, a professional writer, content provider and website developer with
        extensive experience delivering print and digital content over
        different platforms. My professional writing has covered many topics and industries,
        including consumer electronics, interior design, apparel and baseball. For each
        project I have injected descriptors, information and, where applicable, humor to
        communicate the essentials of the product and story. I also have years of experience drafting, editing
        and proofreading in other fields, such as music journalism and legal writing. I
        have worked in a wide variety of roles and can easily adapt my broad skillset to fit your needs.
